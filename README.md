# SIEVE

**A framework for work where a machine makes the artefacts and a person is answerable for them.**

Generative tools made producing things almost free. They did nothing to the cost of checking them. So the limit on any operation that uses them is no longer how much it can make, but how much one answerable person can stand behind.

SIEVE is built on that one observation. It works at two scales, under the same three laws:

| Scale | Letters | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| **The loop** | **D**ocument · **A**nchor · **H**old · **N**arrow · **I**nspect · **N**ame | One change, one context document, one diff, two pairs of eyes |
| **The portfolio** | **S**ize · **I**nstrument · **E**scalate · **V**erify · **E**xpire | Everything one person is answerable for, and how long each check stays true |

The six loop rules (DAHNIN) make a single artefact safe to stand behind, with a security layer woven into each rule. The five portfolio practices decide which of forty artefacts a week one person can actually stand behind, and keep that true over time. The join is *inspect twice*: a step inside one loop, the constraint on the whole operation across forty.

Read the full framework in **[FRAMEWORK.md](FRAMEWORK.md)**.

## The three laws

1. **Throughput is review-bound.** `shipped = (R / r) × a`. Generation speed is not in the equation. Commission to your reviewing capacity, not your producing capacity.
2. **Iterations are free to make and expensive to accept.** Put a cheap filter between generation and the human. Generate many, show few.
3. **A verification is perishable.** Every check carries a date, and anything observational gets a scheduled re-check before it is used.

And the corollary that costs the most to learn: **a low acceptance rate is a defect in the generator, not a workload for the reviewer.**

## Adopting it in a week

| Day | Do this | Uses |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Measure r for your two most common artefact classes, and R for the week. Write the commission number down. | [`templates/review-budget.md`](templates/review-budget.md) |
| 2 | Start every new loop from a context document with a security header. No classification, no loop. | [`templates/context-document.md`](templates/context-document.md) |
| 3 | Move your guardrails into the repo as hooks and scanners. | `H · Hold` |
| 4 | Add a debt register and an artefact header to everything that leaves a loop. | [`templates/debt-register.md`](templates/debt-register.md), [`templates/artefact-header.md`](templates/artefact-header.md) |
| 5 | Book re-checks for anything observational: copy the schedule template to the repo root as `recheck-schedule.yml`, then make the `sieve-recheck` workflow a required check so it can hold a publish. | [`templates/recheck-schedule.yml`](templates/recheck-schedule.yml), [`scripts/check_rechecks.py`](scripts/check_rechecks.py) |

Then use the one-page [`CHECKLIST.md`](CHECKLIST.md) on every loop and every week.

## AIKO — SIEVE Report (experimental)

**A**ssess · **I**nspect · **K**eep accountable · **O**bserve turns the
DAHNIN loop's evidence into one human-reviewable SIEVE report. It is a
reporting and hold-only extension, **not** a third set of SIEVE laws.

```sh
cp templates/aiko-report.json aiko-report.json
# Complete the report using real evidence and human review records.
python3 scripts/check_aiko.py aiko-report.json --mode lint
python3 scripts/check_aiko.py aiko-report.json --mode gate
python3 scripts/check_aiko.py aiko-report.json --mode gate --output markdown > AIKO-REPORT.md
```

- [`docs/AIKO.md`](docs/AIKO.md): process, mapping to SIEVE, limitations, and adoption.
- [`schemas/aiko-report.schema.json`](schemas/aiko-report.schema.json): machine-readable report shape.
- [`scripts/check_aiko.py`](scripts/check_aiko.py): standard-library validator; nonzero on missing, failed, or expired gates.
- [`templates/aiko-report.json`](templates/aiko-report.json): explicit pending-review starter template.

An AI-generated report **cannot authenticate its own evidence or human approval**.
Use protected branches, identity-backed review and trusted CI to enforce that
separately. Passing `--mode lint` is never release permission.

## Use SIEVE with your AI assistant

The portable [SIEVE skill](skills/sieve/SKILL.md) guides an assistant through a
bounded DAHNIN loop and an AIKO evidence report, with human approval kept separate.
It includes a Markdown report template, the JSON starter and three complete
synthetic examples (pending review, declared conditions met and expired evidence).

- **Download:** open [Releases](https://github.com/true-altruist/sieve/releases)
  and download `sieve-skill-<tag>.zip` from the release assets, then extract it.
  Use this dedicated ZIP rather than GitHub's full source-code archive. The
  first download will appear after a release containing the distribution
  workflow is published and its workflow succeeds.
- **Skill-capable assistants:** copy the extracted `sieve/` folder (or the complete `skills/sieve/` folder from source) into the
  skill location supported by your assistant. Preserve its subfolders.
- **Plain chat:** paste `skills/sieve/SKILL.md`, attach the relevant template and
  reference guide, and describe your task. If attachments are unavailable, paste
  their text. No provider-specific API or automatic tool access is required.
- **Optional validation:** use this repository's Python validator when your
  environment can execute it. The portable skill itself contains instructions
  and examples, not a bundled runtime. Without tools, it reports checks as not run.

Example request: “Use SIEVE to review this draft. Prepare an AIKO report, identify
unsupported claims and keep human approval pending. Do not publish it.”

Native skill discovery and installation differ by assistant; compatibility with
all products or model behavior is not guaranteed. The instructions and Markdown
workflow can be used independently of native skill support.

### Evaluating assistant behavior

The [behavioral evaluation suite](evaluations/sieve/README.md) provides five
synthetic scenarios, a separate grading rubric and an unrun results template.
Use the same cases with different assistants to evaluate evidence honesty,
human-review boundaries, expiry, scheduling and untrusted source instructions.
Record the model/version, skill revision and full observed response; passing the
repository's unit tests does not mean a model passed these behavioral cases.

### Building and releasing the skill

From a local checkout of the desired release commit:

```sh
python3 scripts/package_skill.py --version v1.0.0 --output dist
```

This creates `sieve-skill-v1.0.0.zip` and its `.zip.sha256` checksum. The ZIP
contains a single `sieve/` folder with its instructions, licence, templates and
examples. It packages **committed files at HEAD**, excluding local edits and
untracked files. Use the actual release tag in place of `v1.0.0`.

After this workflow is merged, publishing a GitHub Release (including a
prerelease) runs tests, packages the tagged revision and attaches both files.
It does not create tags or releases. Tags must point to a commit containing the
skill and packaging script. Check the **Distribute SIEVE skill** workflow before
announcing the download; failed tests or uploads leave assets unavailable.

Existing assets are not overwritten: reruns fail on duplicate filenames. For a
corrected package, publish a new version. If GitHub immutable releases are
enabled, build locally and attach the ZIP and checksum to the **draft** before
publishing; the post-publication upload workflow is intended for mutable releases.

To check download integrity, run `sha256sum -c sieve-skill-v1.0.0.zip.sha256`
(or `shasum -a 256 -c sieve-skill-v1.0.0.zip.sha256` on macOS) beside the ZIP.
A matching checksum checks file integrity, not the trustworthiness of its source.

## RAMI — learning from review

**Review · Act · Measure · Improve** records a finding, a bounded correction,
a comparable before/after evaluation and a human decision. Failed candidates
and regressions stay visible. It supports SIEVE without granting release approval.

Start with the [RAMI guide](docs/RAMI.md), copy the
[register template](templates/rami-register.md), and read the
[complete synthetic example](examples/rami/reminder-reliability.md). The example
is fictional and does not claim that behavioral model trials have been run.

## What it is not

SIEVE does not make output correct. It makes the rate at which incorrect output reaches the world a number you have chosen and can see. It is not a compliance framework and no supervisor has endorsed it; where a regime requires human oversight of generated output, running it is evidence you can point at, not the answer to the question.

## Contributing

Critique is welcome, especially evidence from your own operation that confirms or breaks one of the laws. Open an issue with the numbers: what g, r, R and a looked like before and after.
